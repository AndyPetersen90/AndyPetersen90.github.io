                    My journy to becoming a Web Developer started after I began working at a software company as a phone sales rep. In the past, if you had asked me what I thought
                    it would take to be a Web Developer, I would have said it had something to do with a 4 year degree. As I got to know the wonderful developers at this company,
                    I soon realized that there were many who had taught themselves how to code or had gone to a bootcamp to learn. I took this as a sign to do some digging.
                    I began obtaining resources to learn about the many programming languages. I even started developing my first HTML and CSS project as a blog
                    website about my family. As I watched the website come to life with the code I was learning, I became excited to see what my hands could build. 
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-paragraphs">
                    It took some time for me to become confident in making a career change. In 2022, my wife and I decided it was time to pursue a career that brought me joy,
                    allowed me to be creative, and would supply a great opportunity for me to continually grow. I registered for DevMountains Web Development program. Throughout
                    this program I learned even more about the development world, the languages that are available, the different skills and opportunities a development career provides.
                    This only fueled my desire even more. As I progressed through the program, I was even more excited to see the diffrent skills I was developing and how those can
                    benefit the world.

                    If I am not at my computer coding, you can find me enjoying some hobbies. In my pass time, I enjoy working on wood projects, fishing with my family, going on hikes,
                    watching movies at home and in the theater, and exercising.

                    Becoming a developer has opened my life up to a slue of posibilites for me and my family. I cant wait to see how you and I can help solve the worlds problems
